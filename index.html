            <p>
              Groundwater pollution (also called groundwater contamination)
              occurs when pollutants are released to the ground and make 
              their way into groundwater. This type of water pollution can 
              also occur naturally due to the presence of a minor and unwanted 
              constituent, contaminant, or impurity in the groundwater, in which
              case it is more likely referred to as contamination rather than pollution

            <p>
              Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Oil spills</h3><br>
            <p>
              An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land.

            <p>
              Unlike most others on this list, microbiological pollution is a naturally occurring form of water contamination. Microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa and viruses can infiltrate water supplies, causing diseases such as bilharzia and cholera. Humans are most susceptible to this kind of pollution in places where adequate water treatment systems are not yet in place.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Chemical water pollution</h3><br>
            <p>
              The most common type of water pollution, chemicals can infiltrate both underground water sources and those sitting on the Earth’s surface. As an integral component of the agricultural industry, it’s unsurprising that much of chemical contamination comes from the pesticides and fungicides used in farming, but metals and solvents from industrial sites are also leading contributors.

            <p>
              Another consequence of algal blooms is their consumption of oxygen supplies. This means that those species which depend upon oxygen to survive are killed off, while anaerobic ones thrive. Some anaerobic microorganisms are capable of producing ammonia, sulphides and other harmful toxins, which can make the water even more dangerous to animals (and humans, too).

              By discharging oil, hazardous substances, and other harmful liquids known as effluents into streams, factories turn them into open sewers. The normal purifying cycle of water, which is carried out by microbes, is hampered by these pollutants, which also damage water reservoirs.

            <p>
              Agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater withdrawals. Sustainable farming practices and improved wastewater treatment can help balance economic development with the protection of wetlands and water resources.

              Domestic sewage contains compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, two elements that are basic nutrients essential for the growth of plants. In lakes, excessive amounts of nitrates and phosphates can cause the rapid growth of algae.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Use fewer chemicals to clean your home.</h3><br>
            <p>
              Natural cleaners are just as effective at getting the house clean. It's an easy switch that makes a big difference. Using toxic chemicals like bleach and ammonia to clean your home is not only bad for the water supply, it's not necessary. With natural cleaners, you don't have to worry that you're contributing to water pollution when you use them.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Dispose of waste properly.</h3><br>
            <p>
              Never pour something that isn't biodegradable down the drain. When it is necessary to use something that's toxic to the water supply, such as paint or ammonia, take care to dispose of it properly. If you're not sure how to get rid of something, check your local government's website or contact your sanitation department to find out how toxic waste should be disposed of in your community. The following materials should never be poured down the drain

            <img src="./assets/main/plastic.jpg" alt="pilastics in the ocean" />
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Avoid using plastic.</h3><br>
            <p>
              Since it isn't biodegradable, plastic often ends up collecting in water sources. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, for example, is a huge vortex of trash, mainly plastic, that has collected in the ocean since it has nowhere else to go.[7] This trash endangers marine life and affects humans as well. Whenever possible, use glass or cloth containers instead of plastic.
